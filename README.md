### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer, Pythonista, Rustacean, and proud member of team vim. Currently employed by Remesh. 100% fueled by coffee, 50% of it decaffeinated.

You can find my writing on [my blog](https://ntietz.com). It's updated sporadically.

You can find some of my software here, but what I make public isn't necessarily very good. It's mostly poor hacks that I write to learn something, so please don't judge me _too_ hard from what you see on GitHub.
