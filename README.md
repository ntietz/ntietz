### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer, Pythonista, Rustacean, and proud member of team vim. Currently employed by Remesh. 100% fueled by coffee, 50% of it decaffeinated.

You can find my writing on [my blog](https://ntietz.com). It's updated sporadically.

You can find some of my software here, but what I make public isn't necessarily very good. It's mostly poor hacks that I write to learn something, so please don't judge me _too_ hard from what you see on GitHub.

ðŸ“š Currently reading:
* TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1 (Second Edition)

ðŸ¤” Currently thinking about:
* How do networks really work? Lots of questions, mostly layers 4 and below. Send me any favorite resources you have!
* Why aren't hit counters a thing anymore?
* Can I write software to help immigrants? To improve access to legal resources?
